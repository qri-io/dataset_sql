	// Examples of errors that will cause the RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED code:
	// 1. TxPoolFull: this is retried server-side, and is only returned as an error

	// This could be due to various reasons: QueryService is not serving, should
	// not be serving, wrong shard, wrong tablet type, blacklisted table, etc.

	// Generally, we don't expect the errors to go away by themselves, but they
	// may go away after human intervention.
	// Examples of scenarios where INTERNAL_ERROR is returned:
	//  1. Something is not configured correctly internally.
	//  2. A necessary resource is not available, and we don't expect it to become available by itself.
	//  3. A sanity check fails.
	//  4. Some other internal error occurs.
	// Clients should not retry immediately, as there is little chance of success.
	// However, it's acceptable for retries to happen internally, for example to
	// multiple backends, in case only a subset of backend are not functional.

	// TRANSIENT_ERROR is used for when there is some error that we expect we can
	// recover from automatically - often due to a resource limit temporarily being
	// reached. Retrying this error, with an exponential backoff, should succeed.
	// Clients should be able to successfully retry the query on the same backends.
	// Examples of things that can trigger this error:
	// 1. Query has been throttled
	// 2. VtGate could have request backlog
